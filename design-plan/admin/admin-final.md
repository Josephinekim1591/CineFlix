[← Table of Contents](../design-journey.md)


## Milestone 3 Feedback Revisions
> Explain what you individually revised in response to the Milestone 3 feedback (1-2 sentences)
> If you didn't make any revisions, explain why.

I got points off for not having my media files visible in the Consumer/Admin View all Page so I edited the code so that the files are visible in the admin view all page. Also, I got points off for hard coding the tags so I edited the code to include a for loop looping through the tags so they are not hard coded.


## Grading

### Grading: Device Resolution
> When grading the admin portion of the project, should we use a narrow or wide browser window width?

When grading the admin portion of the project, use a wide browser window width.


### Grading: Step-by-Step Instructions
> Write step-by-step instructions for the graders.
>
> - This project can be hard to grade if we don't understand how your site works.
> - Include all steps. For example, if you must log in before you can delete an entry, say so.
> - For each set of instructions, assume the grader is starting from /

_**Admin** view all entries:_

1. Type into the url /admin/movies.
2. Login in using the username: hannah and password: monkey.

_**Admin** view all entries for a tag:_

1. Click on a tag in the sidebar labeled "Filter Movie by Tag" in the admin view all page (scroll down on the sidebarto see further tags)

_Edit an entry, including the updating the file upload:_

1. Click on the card tile or the edit entry link on the card tile.
2. This will take you to the form where you can upload a new file to edit the old movie image or edit the movie details.

4. Go back to admin view all page by clicking go back or admin view all on nav bar to see changed results.


## Self-Reflection
> Reflect on what you learned during this assignment.
> How have you improved from projects 1 and 2?
> What would you do differently next time? (1-2 sentences)

Throughout this project, I've developed a deeper understanding of user interface design and backend integration. My ability to troubleshoot and debug complex issues has significantly improved compared to my earlier projects. The feedback I received was crucial in helping me refine the user experience, particularly in making the media files visible and dynamically managing the tags. I have significanty improved my php skills in debugging and expanded my backend coding palette. Next time, I would leave more time for emergencies as sometimes I would accidentally change my code when its nearing the deadline and the whole thing wouldn't work and I would have to fix it again.

> Take some time here to reflect on how much you've learned since you started this class. It's often easy to ignore our own progress. Take a moment and think about your accomplishments in this class. Hopefully you'll recognize that you've accomplished a lot and that you should be very proud of those accomplishments! (1-2 sentences)

Looking back at where I started in this class to where I am now, I've gained a wealth of knowledge in web development, especially in PHP and database management. I'm proud of the complex functionality I was able to implement on my site, such as the dynamic filtering of entries by tags, creating forms with get information using sql and update files, which was a challenging yet rewarding task.
