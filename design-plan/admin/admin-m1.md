# Project 3, Milestone 1: **Administrator** Design Journey

[← Table of Contents](../design-journey.md)

## _Cohesive_ Audience
> Briefly explain your site's **administrator** audience.
> Your audience should be specific, but not arbitrarily specific.

Our site's administrator audience is comprised of movie database managers and content editors who work for online movie platforms or databases.

> Be specific and justify why this audience is a **cohesive** group. (1-2 sentences)

This audience is cohesive because their primary role revolves around maintaining an accurate and up-to-date database of movies, including managing movie details, posters, and categorization.

## Audience Goals
> Document your **administrator** audience's goals.
> List each goal below. There is no specific number of goals required for this, but you need
> enough to do the job (Hint: It's at least 1, but probably no more than 3).

Goal 1: Catalog Updating: Seamlessly add new movies to the catalog, including uploading posters and inputting detailed information.

Goal 2: Catalog Editing: Edit existing movie entries to correct details, update ratings, or change the movie's poster image.

Goal 3: Content Organization: Ensure the catalog is neatly categorized by genre and release year to facilitate easy navigation for users.


## Persona
> Use the goals you identified to develop a persona of your site's **administrator** audience.
> Your persona must have a name and a face. The face can be a photo of a face or a drawing, etc.
> You may type out the persona below with bullet points or include an image of the persona.
> Just make sure it's easy to read the persona when previewing markdown.
