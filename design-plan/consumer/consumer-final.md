[← Table of Contents](../design-journey.md)


## Milestone 3 Feedback Revisions
> Explain what you individually revised in response to the Milestone 3 feedback (1-2 sentences)
> If you didn't make any revisions, explain why.

I revised the website so that the tags are filtered correctly using the table and made sure the files show up for them. Also, I edited the form so that the jpg file uploaded can be seen in the catalog and recorded in the database.

## Grading

### Grading: Device Resolution
> When grading the consumer portion of the project, should we use a narrow or wide browser window width?

You should use a wide browser window width.


### Grading: Step-by-Step Instructions
> Write step-by-step instructions for the graders.
>
> - This project can be hard to grade if we don't understand how your site works.
> - Include all steps. For example, if you must log in before you can delete an entry, say so.
> - For each set of instructions, assume the grader is starting from /

_**Consumer** view all entries:_

1. The user should be able to see the movie catalog of all entries when they first open the website on the "view all movies" page and be able to scroll to see all.
2. ...

## Self-Reflection
> Reflect on what you learned during this assignment.
> How have you improved from projects 1 and 2?
> What would you do differently next time? (1-2 sentences)

From the last two projects, I have learned a lot, especially in improving the appearance of a catalog page with media files and learning how to filter things with tags and also implement a login/logout link. The only thing I would do differently next time is better understand join clauses and using queries for tags so that I don't get any points off and better understand by code when I run into errors.


> Take some time here to reflect on how much you've learned since you started this class. It's often easy to ignore our own progress. Take a moment and think about your accomplishments in this class. Hopefully you'll recognize that you've accomplished a lot and that you should be very proud of those accomplishments! (1-2 sentences)

I am really proud of how much I was able to learn from the beginning of this project. From not knowing how to do any tables or forms, it's really cool to see how far I've come to create a working catalog page with media files.
