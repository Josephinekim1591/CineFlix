[← Table of Contents](../design-journey.md)

## _Cohesive_ Audience
> Briefly explain your site's **consumer** audience.
> Your audience should be specific, but not arbitrarily specific.

The site's consumer audience are any movie enthusiasts or casual movie watchers that are interested in discovering, exploring, and watching different movies and new titles.

> Be specific and justify why this audience is a **cohesive** group. (1-2 sentences)

This is a cohesive group because both movie enthusiasts and casual movie watchers enjoy discovering and exploring different movies, regardless of their knowledge or depth of engagement with the subjects. They also both share the desire for discovering new titles and experiencing a unique variety of cinematic experiences.


## Audience Goals
> Document your **consumer** audience's goals.
> List each goal below. There is no specific number of goals required for this, but you need
> enough to do the job (Hint: It's at least 1, but probably no more than 3).

Goal 1: Easily discover new and popular movies of different genres they enjoy that they have not encountered before

Goal 2: Find newly released movies and see the descriptions and information about them to see if it matches their interests

Goal 3: See the reviews to movies they are looking forward to watching or have watched already to get an understanding of the overall public opinion about them


## Persona
> Use the goals you identified to develop a persona of your site's **consumer** audience.
> Your persona must have a name and a face. The face can be a photo of a face or a drawing, etc.
> You may type out the persona below with bullet points or include an image of the persona.
> Just make sure it's easy to read the persona when previewing markdown.
