# Project 3, Final Milestone: **Team** Design Journey

[← Table of Contents](design-journey.md)

**Make the case for your decisions using concepts from class, as well as other design principles, theories, examples, and cases from outside of class (includes the design prerequisite for this course).**

You can use bullet points and lists, or full paragraphs, or a combo, whichever is appropriate. The writing should be solid draft quality.


## Milestone 3 Team Feedback Revisions
> Explain what your **team** collectively revised in response to the Milestone 3 feedback (1-2 sentences)
> If you didn't make any revisions, explain why.

We edited our tags query so that it uses the table and is not hard coded and edited the edit/insert forms so that the files uploaded through the form show up on the view all pages.

## Collective Implementation
> Explain how your team **collectively** implemented sessions and user access controls. (1-2 sentences)
> If one person did not contribute, simply state that.

We collectively implemented the sessions and user access controls by designing the login page together and creating the tables for the sessions and users in init.sql. We worked together to make the admin side only accessible once logged in.
